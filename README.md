# doubly-linked-list-MIPS
Implementation of a doubly linked list in MIPS assembly language

## Compile
Download the .s file.

I use QtSpim to compile assembly code.
In QtSpim, go to "File"->"Reinitialize and Load file". Then select the file, and press F5 or click on the "Run/Continue" arrow.

The menu is in Spanish, and the console doesn't let you erase characters.
